## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Used for form management
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Dev/Build tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

On this occasion, I mainly reinforced the handling of forms in React using the React Hook Form library. I also learned to sharpen my sense of sight to be able to layout the designs as accurately as possible.
For the organization of the styles (and to make DX easier for me), I set the styles provided in the Tailwind configuration, achieving a much more accurate and quicker style selection.

### Continued development

I found it challenging, in part, to handle the form state, more so because of having to validate the date types and the inherent properties this entails.
